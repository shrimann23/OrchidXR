RevereXR Hackathon Project:  a 3D Augmented Reality web application, "Orchid XR" to tell Mrs. Toliver's life story interactively. See our demo video here: https://lnkd.in/gMgirE3s. Our web application allows our users to "travel" in a bus through Seattle's Central District, experiencing each of the places and memories central to Mrs. Toliver's story. I'm proud of our team 
(Arya Sanjay, Shrimayee Narasimhan, Eileen Dong, Chantal Zhou) for creating an AR experience using 8th Wall AR, Unity, and Blender in conjunction for the first time!
